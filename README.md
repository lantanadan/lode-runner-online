<b><a href = "https://github.com/lantanadan/lode-runner-online/blob/main/Arena%20One.PZL">Arena One (September 9, 2025):</b></a> My first attempt at a four-player PvP level! Players race around the arena to collect all Gold, and are given access to snares, slime buckets, respawning bombs, a pickaxe, and the key to their specific door. The teleporters take players around the level in a clockwise fashion, hunting and attacking each other in order to get all the gold and be the first to escape.
<p>This level has not been tested in multiplayer yet so please send me your feedback!</p>

<b><a href = "https://github.com/lantanadan/lode-runner-online/blob/main/Recursion%20Error.PZL">Recursion Error (September 6, 2025):</b></a> Four loops, four monks, lots of gold. How quickly can you get out? This is just a quick little level I whipped together. It doesn't seem challenging at first, but the monks quickly team up against you, which makes getting OUT of the level pretty interesting.
