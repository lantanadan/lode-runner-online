<b>Recursion Error (September 6, 2025):</b> Four loops, four monks, lots of gold. How quickly can you get out? This is just a quick little level I whipped together. It doesn't seem challenging at first, but the monks quickly team up against you, which makes getting OUT of the level pretty interesting.
